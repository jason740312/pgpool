 <para>
  Since <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> is a middleware that works between
  <productname>PostgreSQL</> servers and a <productname>PostgreSQL</> database client, so when a client application
  connects to the <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>, <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>
  inturn connects to the <productname>PostgreSQL</> servers using the same credentials to serve the incomming
  client connection. Thus, all the access privileges and restrictions defined for the user in <productname>PostgreSQL</>
  gets automatically applied to all <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> clients, with an exceptions of
  the authentications on <productname>PostgreSQL</> side that depends on the client's IP addresses or host names.
  Reason being the connections to the <productname>PostgreSQL</> server are made by <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>
  on behalf of the connecting clients and <productname>PostgreSQL</> server can only see the IP address of the
  <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> server and not that of the actual client.
  Therefore, for the client host based authentications <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> has the
  <literal>pool_hba</literal> mechanism similar to the <literal>pg_hba</literal> mechanism for
  authenticating the incomming client connections.

  <title>The <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> File</title>

  <indexterm zone="auth-pool-hba-conf">
   <primary>pool_hba.conf</primary>
  </indexterm>

  <para>
  Just like the <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> file for <productname>PostgreSQL</>,
  <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> supports a similar client authentication
  function using a configuration file called <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename>.
  <productname>Pgpool-II</productname> installation also includes the sample
  <filename>pool_hba.conf.sample</filename> file in the default configuration directory
  (<literal>"/usr/local/etc"</literal>).
  By default, pool_hba authentication is disabled, and setting <varname>enable_pool_hba</varname>
  to <literal>on</literal> enables it. see the <xref linkend="guc-enable-pool-hba"> configuration parameter.
  </para>

  <para>
   The format of the <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> file follows very closely <productname>PostgreSQL</>'s <filename>pg_hba.conf</filename> format.

   The general format of the <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> file is
   a set of records, one per line. Blank lines are ignored, as is any
   text after the <literal>#</literal> comment character.
   Records cannot be continued across lines.
   A record is made
   up of a number of fields which are separated by spaces and/or tabs.
   Fields can contain white space if the field value is double-quoted.
   Quoting one of the keywords in a database, user, or address field (e.g.,
   <literal>all</> or <literal>replication</>) makes the word lose its special
   meaning, and just match a database, user, or host with that name.
  </para>

  <para>
   Each record specifies a connection type, a client IP address range
   (if relevant for the connection type), a database name, a user name,
   and the authentication method to be used for connections matching
   these parameters. The first record with a matching connection type,
   client address, requested database, and user name is used to perform
   authentication. There is no <quote>fall-through</> or
   <quote>backup</>: if one record is chosen and the authentication
   fails, subsequent records are not considered. If no record matches,
   access is denied.
  </para>

  <para>
   A record can have one of the following formats

     <term><replaceable>address</replaceable></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
      Specifies the client machine address(es) that this record matches.
      This field can contain either a host name, an IP address range,
      or one of the special key words mentioned below.
      </para>

      <para>
      An IP address range is specified using standard numeric notation for
      the range's starting address, then a slash (<literal>/</literal>)
      and a <acronym>CIDR</acronym> mask length.
      The mask length indicates the number of high-order bits of the client
      IP address that must match. Bits to the right of this should be zero
      in the given IP address. There must not be any white space between the
      IP address, the <literal>/</literal>, and the CIDR mask length.
      </para>

      <para>
      Typical examples of an IPv4 address range specified this way are
      <literal>172.20.143.89/32</literal> for a single host, or
      <literal>172.20.143.0/24</literal> for a small network, or
      <literal>10.6.0.0/16</literal> for a larger one.
      An IPv6 address range might look like <literal>::1/128</literal> for
      a single host (in this case the IPv6 loopback address) or
      <literal>fe80::7a31:c1ff:0000:0000/96</literal> for a small network.
      <literal>0.0.0.0/0</literal> represents all IPv4 addresses, and
      <literal>::0/0</literal> represents all IPv6 addresses. To specify a
      single host, use a mask length of 32 for IPv4 or 128 for IPv6.
      In a network address, do not omit trailing zeroes.
      </para>

      <para>
      An entry given in IPv4 format will match only IPv4 connections, and
      an entry given in IPv6 format will match only IPv6 connections, even
      if the represented address is in the IPv4-in-IPv6 range.
      Note that entries in IPv6 format will be rejected if the system's C
      library does not have support for IPv6 addresses.
      </para>

      <para>
      You can also write <literal>all</literal> to match any IP address, 
      <literal>samehost</literal> to match any
      of the server's own IP addresses, or samenet to match any address in
      any <literal>subnet</literal> that the server is directly connected to.
      </para>

      <para>
      If a host name is specified (anything that is not an IP address range or
      a special key word is treated as a host name), that name is compared with
      the result of a reverse name resolution of the client's IP address
      (e.g., reverse DNS lookup, if DNS is used). Host name comparisons are
      case insensitive. If there is a match, then a forward name resolution
      (e.g., forward DNS lookup) is performed on the host name to check whether
      any of the addresses it resolves to are equal to the client's IP address.
      If both directions match, then the entry is considered to match.
      (The host name that is used in <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> should be the one that
      address-to-name resolution of the client's IP address returns, otherwise
      the line won't be matched. Some host name databases allow associating an
      IP address with multiple host names, but the operating system will only
      return one host name when asked to resolve an IP address.)
      </para>

      <para>
      A host name specification that starts with a dot (<literal>.</literal>) matches 
      a suffix of the actual host name. So <literal>.example.com</literal> would match
      <literal>foo.example.com</literal> (but not just <literal>example.com</literal>).
      </para>

      <para>
      When host names are specified in <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename>, you should
      make sure that name resolution is reasonably fast. It can be of advantage to
      set up a local name resolution cache such as <acronym>nscd</acronym>.
      </para>

      <para>
      This field only applies to host, hostssl, and hostnossl records.
      </para>
      <para>
      Specifying the host name in address field is not supported prior to

      <para>
      These two fields can be used as an alternative to the 
      <replaceable>IP-address</><literal>/</><replaceable>mask-length</> notation.
      Instead of specifying the mask length, the actual mask is specified in a separate column.
      For example, <literal>255.0.0.0</literal> represents an IPv4 <acronym>CIDR</acronym> mask
      length of <literal>8</literal>, and <literal>255.255.255.255</literal> represents a
      <acronym>CIDR</acronym> mask length of 32.

  </para>

  <para>
   Since the <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> records are examined
   sequentially for each connection attempt, the order of the records is
   significant. Typically, earlier records will have tight connection
   match parameters and weaker authentication methods, while later
   records will have looser match parameters and stronger authentication
   methods. For example, one might wish to use <literal>trust</>
   authentication for local TCP/IP connections but require a password for
   remote TCP/IP connections. In this case a record specifying
   <literal>trust</> authentication for connections from 127.0.0.1 would
   appear before a record specifying password authentication for a wider
   range of allowed client IP addresses.

  <tip>
    <para>
        All pool_hba authentication options described in this section are
        about the authentication taking place between a client and the
        <productname>Pgpool-II</productname>.
        A client still has to go through the <productname>PostgreSQL</>'s authentication
        process and must have the <literal>CONNECT</> privilege for the
        database on the backend <productname>PostgreSQL</> server.
    </para>
    <para>
        As far as pool_hba is concerned, it does not matter if a user name
        and/or database name given by a client
        (i.e. <command>psql -U testuser testdb</command>)
        really exists in the backend. pool_hba only cares if a match in the
        <filename>pool_hba.conf</filename> can be found or not.
